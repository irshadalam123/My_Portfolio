# **The Projects**
---

## [**Project 1: Alcohol Quality Checker**](https://github.com/manthanpatel98/Alcohol-Quality-Checker)
* The Dataset has **'density'**, **'pH'**, **'sulphates'**, **'alcohol'**, **'Quality_Category'** columns. It has **4898 rows** and **5 columns**.
* From the Dataset, we have to predict the **Quality of Alcohol**: **"High"** or **"Low"**.
* **ExtraTreesClassifier** has been used for Feature Selection.
* I have applied **Random Forest**, **Decision Tree**, **K-NN**, **Naive bayes classification** and **SVM** algorithms but at the end, **KNN** gave better results.
