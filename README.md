# **My_Portfolio**
**Here are the Projects that I have done.**

---
## [**Project 1: Alcohol Quality Checker**](https://github.com/manthanpatel98/Alcohol-Quality-Checker)
* The Dataset has **'density'**, **'pH'**, **'sulphates'**, **'alcohol'**, **'Quality_Category'** columns. It has **4898 rows** and **5 columns**.
* From the Dataset, we have to predict the **Quality of Alcohol**: **"High"** or **"Low"**.
* **ExtraTreesClassifier** has been used for Feature Selection.
* I have applied **Random Forest**, **Decision Tree**, **K-NN**, **Naive bayes classification** and **SVM** algorithms but at the end, **KNN** gave better results.

## [**Project 2: Titanic Disaster**](https://github.com/manthanpatel98/Titanic)
* The Dataset has **"PassengerId"**, **"Survived"**, **"Pclass"**, **"Name"**, **"Sex"**, **"Age"**, **"SibSp"**, **"Parch"**, **"Ticket"**, **"Fare"**, **"Cabin"**, **"Embarked"** columns. It has total around **1300 rows** and **12 columns**.
* From the Dataset, we have to predict the **Survived** column: 
* **ExtraTreesClassifier** has been used for **Feature Selection**.
* I have used **Count/Frequency Encoding** Technique for **Feature Encoding**.
* I have applied many different algorithms but at the end, **KNN** gave better results.

## [**Project 3: Spam Classifier**](https://github.com/manthanpatel98/SpamClassifier)
* Message and its final output is separated by Tab space.
* From the Dataset, we have to predict the **label** column: 
* **PortStemmer** method has been used for **Stemming**.
* I have applied many different algorithms **RandomForestClassifier**, **MultinomialNB**, **SVM** and **KNN**.

## [**Project 4: Restaurant Review Sentiment Analysis**](https://github.com/manthanpatel98/Restaurant-Review-Sentiment-Analysis)
* Dataset has **10000 rows** and **8 columns**.
* We have to predict whether a review is **"Positive"** or **"Negative"**.
* **PortStemmer** method has been used for **Stemming**.
* I have applied many different algorithms **RandomForestClassifier**, **MultinomialNB**, **SVM** and **KNN**.
